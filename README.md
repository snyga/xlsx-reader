# xlxs_reader
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a database written in excel (xlsx).
At the moment the xlsx had the need for the first header to be ' ID '. There must also be a header named 'Plastic Type'.

# How to install
## Download and ready for use as is (Windows 10, 11):
  * Go ahead and download the edit_status_0.2.exe and it should be ready to use. You need to place it next to a folder named `polymer_storage` to work.

## Install with PyInstaller (not windows): 
* Download the repository and place it in the same directory as your xlsx files. 
  * Install PyInstaller with `pip install pyinstaller` ([PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)).
  * In your terminal run `python build_with_PyInstaller.py` to replace the exe file in `Basement_Status`

### Requirements for installation
[PySimpleGUI](https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/#install) and [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

* `pip install -U pysimplegui`
* `pip install PyInstaller`

# Goals
To make the GUI a lot more general so it can read any kind of xlsx based database.
